# APMEX Wholesale Email

- `orig.html` is the original email template I was given
- `wholesale.html` is the template
- `example.html` is the template with example data
- `apmex-wholesale-400x51.png` is an updated logo file. I didn't know where to upload it.
- `config.codekit` can be ignored 

The template is based off of Scott's templates we are using for all the other emails. Everything should be in order. If you have any questions please email me [stewart.hines@apmex.com](mailto:stewart.hines@apmex.com) and I will answer them. Thanks!
